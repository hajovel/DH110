### Digital Humanities 110

This space is for the class Digital Humanities 110 where my project is based on familial connection. Focusing on many estranged relationships neurodivergent people may have with family, in addition to safety-precautions for these communities as well as other endangered groups such as women, my app/website's premise allows for family members to easily check in on family members by sending reminders of specific dates and events, setting reminders to check in and reply to family members, and sharing location for safety tracking.
